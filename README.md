one of the most lazy minecraft mods u can find in existence cuz why not

The project itself is discontinued, with spinoffs RedstoneBuilder and Lazycraft currently developing. Basically I just change the names of the mods lol

Also, for it to run properly, it requires 'Heart of Ender' and 'Ice and Fire' mods to work. Find them on CurseForge

ehh ig dats it
